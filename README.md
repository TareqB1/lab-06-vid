Q2: Explain how the decorator design pattern is a better alternative to the previous two attempts??

Ans:    - You can extend an object’s behavior without making a new subclass.
        - You can add or remove responsibilities from an object at runtime.
        Also, its better to use when it’s awkward or not possible to extend an object’s behavior using inheritance.
